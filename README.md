Problem : Classification of the students based on the large amount of survey data/school of
university data which is very hard to do in software like Excel.

1. For data modelling and clustering we used Kmean, pandas for reading the CSV file,
    matplotlib for graph representation, numpy for mathematical operations, LableEncoder for
    giving label to fields.

2. Imported All the modules that were requited

3. Used very big dataset for analysing

4. Renamed properties/columns for easy navigation

5. Plotted bar chart for taking brief idea about gender vies performance.

6. Plotted means scores according to group.

7. Plotted box chart for how many students had given the per-test.

8. Labeling parent_education, pre-test and lunch by numbers which are easy to process than
    the text.

9. We used kmean for clustering where we can see form the graph that summation of distance
    decrease as we increase numner of clusters.

10. We divided data into 8 clusters.

11. Mean scores for each classification for math, reading and writing.

12. Ranking given to cluster based on its mean value of all 3 scores.

13. Plotted bar chart for analysing clusters based on their parental education.

14. In the last we plotted bar chart for analysing how many students fall in which cluster based
    on per-test given or not, lunch and gender.
